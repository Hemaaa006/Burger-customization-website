# Burger-customization-website
As an online burger selling website, it's imperative to provide customers with the ability to fully customize their burgers. Not only do we offer the option to add or remove ingredients, but we also allow customers to create their own burgers using the available ingredients. To achieve this, we need to create a visual representation for each ingredient that displays the selected layer on the screen. By setting up event listeners, we can allow customers to easily add or remove ingredients by clicking on the respective buttons. Additionally, it's important to visually indicate the active state of the ingredient buttons, making it easier for customers to keep track of their choices.
To make the experience even better, we want to show customers only the ingredients they've selected on the chalkboard. This will ensure that they know exactly what's in their burgers. Once the customer has had fun customizing their burger, it's time for them to pay. Using the prices of each ingredient, we can calculate the cost of the burger and display it to the customer.
